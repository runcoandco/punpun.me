        <p class="memory-text">
            Every day, I fuel my mind and body with care—because every choice I make strengthens my memory and my future.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            I cherish my loved ones, our laughter, our stories—big, small, and especially as Bo.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            Memories aren't meant to fade; they're meant to be lived, relived, and told with way too much detail.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            So, I walk this path with love, purpose, and just the right amount of stubbornness.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            I listen to my body, I nourish it, and I trust that enough is enough.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            I am present. I remember. I thrive. And yes, I’ll eat what benefits me. Never sugar!
