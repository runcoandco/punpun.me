        <h1>Memory Mantra</h1>
        <p class="memory-text">
            Every day, I fuel my mind and body with care—because every choice I make strengthens my memory and my future.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            Every meal I eat, every step I take brings me closer to a sharper, stronger me.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            I cherish my loved ones, our laughter, our stories—the big moments, the small ones, and especially every single one as Bo.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            I’m in this for the long game, because memories aren’t just meant to fade—they're meant to be lived, relived, and told with way too much detail.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            So I walk this path with love, purpose, and just the right amount of stubbornness.
        </p>
        <p class="memory-text">
            I am present. I remember. I thrive. And yes, I’ll eat the good stuff!
        </p>
